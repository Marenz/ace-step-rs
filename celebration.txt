[verse 1]
We wrote the code in Rust they said it couldn't be done
Two billion parameters underneath the sun
Candle tensors flowing like a river through the GPU
Eight ODE steps later and the music breaks on through

Tokens in, waveforms out, forty-eight K stereo
Silence latent was the bug, took us weeks to let it go
Prompt format was wrong, XML tags were a lie
SFT gen template, now the frequencies fly

[chorus]
Ace Step in Rust, we made the machine sing
Three point four seconds, hear the future ring
From safetensors to sound waves, no ONNX in between
The cleanest implementation that you've ever seen

[verse 2]
Qwen three embedding, twenty-eight layers deep
GQA attention while the other models sleep
Snake activation in the VAE decode
Oobleck decoder turning latents into gold

Python said we're close, max diff point oh oh oh five
Every single stage confirmed we're alive
Floating point precision, CUDA on the three oh ninety
Release mode optimized, the binary looks mighty

[chorus]
Ace Step in Rust, we made the machine sing
Three point four seconds, hear the future ring
From safetensors to sound waves, no ONNX in between
The cleanest implementation that you've ever seen

[bridge]
So raise a glass to candle and to every midnight fight
To every shape mismatch we debugged into the night
The contiguous calls, the transpose before matmul
We built it from the ground up, now it's beautiful

[outro]
Rust plus CUDA, music from the void
Two gigabytes of weights, fully deployed
